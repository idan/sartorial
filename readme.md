# Sartorial

A pleasantly clean dark theme for the [Textual IRC client](http://codeux.com/textual/).

## What's awesome about it?

* It's dark.
* Nice colors! (Mostly appropriated from Chris Kempson's [Tomorrow theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme)).
* Sensible typography courtesy of Adobe's Source family. Monospaced Source Code for the body content, proportional Source Sans for other bits.
* Timestamps are on the right, but only show up when you hover, to reduce visual clutter

## Installing?

It depends if you have a sandboxed build of Textual. Check out the theme folder to the relevant location:

* Sandboxed: ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.textual/Data/Library/Application Support/Textual IRC/Styles/sartorial
* Non-sandboxed: ~/Library/Application Support/Textual IRC/Styles/sartorial
